# Sepsis_Classification_Machine_Learning_API_using_FastAPI

# ðŸ‘‹Overview
The project was aimed at exploring Trends and Predictors in Patient Data to Uncover the Secrets of Sepsis Occurances. Machine Learning was built provide accurate and efficient classification of sepsis cases using the **FastAPI** framework and **Docker**.

# ðŸ“‚Project Objective
The objectives of the project are as follows:
- Train a machine learning model on a diverse dataset of sepsis cases to accurately predict the likelihood of sepsis in patients.

- Utilize the FastAPI framework to create a user-friendly and efficient web interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the sepsis classification model.

- Improve diagnostic capabilities by achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in sepsis classification.

- Provide a comprehensive and scalable solution that can be easily deployed in real-time healthcare environments.

## ðŸ“« Dataset USED

The data used in this project consists of a diverse collection of sepsis cases obtained from **[Sepsis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaunguynnghunh/sepsis?select=README.md)**.

| Insurance   | N/A             | If a patient holds a valid insurance card         |

# ðŸŒ± Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1:** Higher plasma glucose levels (PRG) are associated with an increased risk of developing sepsis.

- **Hypothesis 2:** Abnormal blood work results, such as high values of PL, SK, and BD2, are indicative of a higher likelihood of sepsis.

- **Hypothesis 3:** Older patients are more likely to develop sepsis compared to younger patients.

- **Hypothesis 4:** Patients with higher body mass index (BMI) values (M11) have a lower risk of sepsis.

- **Hypothesis 5:** Patients without valid insurance cards are more likely to develop sepsis.

The above hypothesis aided in providing more insight for further analysis
